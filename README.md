# Dosa Restaurant Order Processor

## Overview

This project processes customer orders from a JSON file and generates two new files:

1. `customers.json` - A list of customers with their phone numbers and names.
2. `items.json` - A list of items, their prices, and how many times each item was ordered.

## Usage

To run the script:

```bash
python process_orders.py <path_to_json_file>
```
